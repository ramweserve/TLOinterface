/**
 * 
 *           FROM N4 TO TLO
 *           
 *           A `RailcarConsistNotification` is sent in case the consist of the railcars on the terminal's serviceable tracks is affected
 *           (e.g. new railcars or sub-trains being spotted, railcars being removed, etc.).
 *           This notification includes all railcars of the affected tracks, with the railcars being grouped by track.
 *           Upon receiving this notification, TLO will replace all railcars on those tracks with this new information 
 *           (i.e. all information about the railcars are required in this new notification).
 *           Not affected tracks will not be changed by TLO. With this approach it can be still ensured that TLO 
 *           moves from one consistent state into another consistent state.
 *
